# GyaanINIT
An app to make online education seamless and comprehensive with content sharing and video calling features.

Client:
- To run client, cd into client folder and run npm install
- Run npm init to start the client on localhost:3000

Server:
- To run server cd into server folder and run npm install
- Create .env file and type PORT=8080, hit Enter/Return and save the file
- Run node app.js to run this server on localhost:8080
- You can "npm install nodemon" to run a development server and following this you can use nodmeon app.js instead of node app.js

Currently the app is just a mere idea of 4 enthusiastic BITS undergrads who are ready to challenge COVID-19 pandemic with a new way to incorporate online education in our lives and spreading knowledge.
